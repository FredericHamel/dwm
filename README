dwm - dynamic window manager
============================
dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.

Requirements
------------
In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files.
And mesonbuild build system which use ninja instead of make.


Installation
------------
Enter the following command as non-root user (it should not required
root access at this step):

    meson . build
    ninja -C build

This should build dwm using the default options.
Afterward enter the following command (as root if needed)
to install it into /usr/local:

    ninja -C build install

You can change the installation directory with the DESTDIR
environment variable.

If you are going to use the default bluegray color scheme it is highly
recommended to also install the bluegray files shipped in the dextra package.

Running dwm
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start dwm using startx:

    exec dwm

In order to connect dwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec dwm

(This will start dwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

In order to display status info in the bar, you can do something
like this in your .xinitrc:

    while xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
    do
    	sleep 1
    done &
    exec dwm


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of dwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
